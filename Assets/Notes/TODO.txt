X intermediate crosshair
- hide the cursor for mouse version
- distance based throw? golf like thing?
- time up doesn't kill last ball that's been thrown
- maybe a risky sprint, harder to control - the more you hold the button the faster you go, no terminal velocity, but lose some control somehow, have to let up at the right time to catch the ball
- three colliders for the three colors
- angled shots get larger colliders
- (powerup) R/L button curve your shot
- show where the next goal is going to show up??
- (visual) goals become batters that hit homeruns
- greg wants to know where the ball is going to land even sooner
X instead of target large circle, ball will fall in a random point within that circle
- never give you an impossible ball
